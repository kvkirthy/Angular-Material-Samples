                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, RxJS - Reactive Extensions JavaScript is dealing with streams of data asynchronously. Observables
                is one of the important aspects of RxJS. Observable results in stream of data. Many times, for understanding
                Observables they are compared to Promises. Both deal with asynchronous actions. Difference is unlike Observable,
                Promise is done once the asynchronous operation is complete. Consider a Http call. Promise is complete once
                response is obtained (or the call errors out). With Obserables data or items are emitted continuously like
                a stream.
                <br/> Where do we see stream of data in JavaScript, especially in a browser? I could think of couple of examples,
                Data bound to UI controls: As user interacts with the UI, edits a text field, selects an option in the drop
                down, and continues to do so, there are series of changes emitted from the control. Web Socket - a persistent
                connection. Server could send a stream of data. As long as the connection is open, browser (or other clients)
                could continue to obtain new pieces of data. Unlike a XHR, it's not done once we receive response soon after
                establishing connection. Another difference between Promises and Observables is that, Observables can be
                unsubscribed (cancelled).
                <br/> In the blog, I'm planning to write about "Typeahead search". Here the UI control is an Observable.
                It emits data items. As user starts keying in search term into the text box results are updated. It triggers
                XHR request with each change or set of key strokes in the text field. Show results using the latest response.
                Cancel in-progress, old and obsolete XHRs.
                <br/> Sample is using AngularJS (v1.x) and RxJS libraries to code this functionality. Run with Angular 1.x
                bower install angular angular-rx
                <br/> Reference the libraries
                <br/> Bootstrap Angular module with "rx" module as a dependency.
                <br/> Consider the following template for text field. This is where user keys in the search term.
                <br/> Notice we are calling "search()" controller function (on $scope) for changes detected with the text
                field. In the controller inject "rx" service for creating an Observable and $http for making API calls.
                <br/> Create an observable function using rx service API,
                <br/> RxJS has galore of operators (which are functions in JS). Before I describe one such operator, remember
                an Observable emits items or data. In our example as and when user keys in values into text field, observable
                is emitting the text to all observers (subscribers). Each search term results in search result (from the
                API). And we have series of results. That means we have Observables of Observables.
                <br/> Consider following code, searchControlObservable = searchControlObservable
                <br/> The callback for flatMapLatest is invoked for every emitted item of searchControlObservable (which
                is result of text field change events). This in turn returns Observables out of XHR calls. These are Observables
                from promises.
                <br/> flatMap is an operator, useful in such scenarios where we have Observables of Observables. It transforms
                and merges. A variant of flatMap is flatMapLatest. In our scenario only the latest search result matters.
                Previous ones could be ignored. So it stops or unsubscribes from previous Observables. As stated earlier
                unlike Promises, Observables could be stopped or unsubscribed from.
                <br/> Also notice debounce(500); It will hold off emitting items for 500 ms. This will help control number
                of XHR calls. We can increase / decrease the number depending on the requirement, acceptable limit for load
                on the API etc. Ideally we want search calls made for considerable text keyed-in, instead of every little
                change.
